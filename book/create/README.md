# Creating or importing books

When creating books, your are prompted with several alternatives:

- Create from a template like _Basic_, or _Science_ (already configured to use `mathjax`)
- Import a book from GitHub (see [hosting on GitHub](../github.md#importing-from-an-existing-github-repository)), or other git repositories
- Import from a document ([detailed process here](import-documents.md))

### Import from Git

If you have a project hosted on another version control system (GIT), you can automatically import it to GitBook when creating a book.

For password protected Git repository, you can use an HTTPS url with inlined authentication, ex:

```
https://username:password@bitbucket.org/you/yourproject.git
```
