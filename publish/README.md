# Publishing on GitBook.com

Once you've [created a book](../book/README.md) on GitBook.com, the next step is to publish content in this book.

### Publish from the editor

The easiest way to edit your book is to use the [GitBook Editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor).

The Editor can be accessed from your web browser using the "Edit" button on the book's headers.

{% hint style="info" %}
The GitBook Editor is also available as a desktop application for Windows, OS X and Linux.
{% endhint %}

### Publish using Git

Developers and pro users can also use [Git](https://git-scm.com) to push new content to their book.

This is detailed under [Update your book using GIT](git.md)
